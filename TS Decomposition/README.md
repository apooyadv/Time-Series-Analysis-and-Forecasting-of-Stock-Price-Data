## Time Series Decomposition Notebook

### TSDecomposition.ipynb

This Jupyter Notebook (`TSDecomposition.ipynb`) is part of the project focusing on Time Series Analysis and Forecasting of Apple Inc.'s stock prices using various statistical and machine learning models.

### Description

The `TSDecomposition.ipynb` notebook performs time series decomposition on the Apple Inc. stock price data to analyze its underlying components: trend, seasonality, and noise.

### Sections Included

1. **Loading and Preprocessing Data**:
   - Code to load historical stock price data of Apple Inc. and preprocess it for time series analysis.

2. **Time Series Decomposition**:
   - Implementation of decomposition techniques such as seasonal decomposition using moving averages (STL decomposition) or classical decomposition methods.

3. **Visualizing Decomposition Results**:
   - Visualization of decomposed components (trend, seasonality, residual) using matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

4. **Analyzing Trends and Seasonality**:
   - Interpretation and analysis of the extracted trend and seasonal components from the stock price data.

5. **Residual Analysis**:
   - Examination of residuals to understand noise or irregular components not explained by trend and seasonality.

### Usage

To use this notebook:
- Clone the repository and navigate to the TS Decomposition directory.
- Open `TSDecomposition.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
- Execute each cell to load, decompose, visualize, and analyze the time series data as described.

### Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
